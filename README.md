# Bank_Management_System

All Bank operations like withdraw deposit edit customer details are added with Springboot. Also validations for withdraw and deposit are added. We cannot withdraw more than what we have in account. At least 2000 must remain while withdraw takes place. Also we cannot enter negative values while depositing resulting in withdrawal instead of deposit.
